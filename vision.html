<h2>My Vision for Ansible-Powered Systems</h2>

<h3>Principles</h3>
<ol>
  <li><em>Systems should be as reliable as possible</em>. 
    Opportunities for dependencies to change behind the scenes should 
    be minimized.  
  </li>
  <li><em>Decoupling points should be clearly defined and maintained.</em>
    We should clearly dictate deliverables so that each team knows 
    whats expected of them.
  </li>
  <li><em>Reliance on infrastructure should be minimized. </em>
    We should rely on as litle as possible.  When we see outages, they will
    likely effect large groups of our systems.  The more infrastructure 
    our operations rely on, the more prerequisites our systems will have 
    to be repaired.  
  </li>
  <li>Artifacts should be as avialable as possible.  This means S3! </li>
</ol>

<h3>Definitions</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Role / Playbook Author</dt> 
    <dd>A developer or engineer, or anybody else,
      who expresses work to be don in ansible.  This might be anybody who 
      has configuration or orchestration work to be done.
    </dd>
  <dt>Ansible Play</dt> <dd>An execution of <code>ansible-playbook</code>,
    potentially executing multiple playbooks.
    </dd>
  <dt>Versioned Artifact</dt> <dd>An archive consisting of all the 
    pieces required to use a particular role or playbook, or supporting 
    files.  This allows a strong degree of confidence that components can 
    develop independently from their consumers.

<p>
  In a nutshell, we write ansible roles & pull them together in playbooks. 
  We build playbooks into artifacts ( including their dependent roles ).
  We then define dependencies on those artifacts for the overal 
  ansible runs.  Each environment has a separate repository of 
  inventory and group_vars, informed by the playbook authors' 
  shipped playbooks.   
</p>
<p>
  CI brings the dependent playbooks together and executes them 
  in the context of one or more environments.  After the play has 
  been executed, the target systems are ready to be snapshotted.  The 
  snapshot ideally would include an AMI, and possibly also a VMDK and/or 
  Vagrant image.  These become the final deliverables of the 
  ansible process.  They are indexed in SimpleDB or another highly 
  available database.
</p>
  Local environments can bring up systems based on the Vagrant box.  The
  same systems can be brough up without modification in Amazon from AMI, 
  or in the datacenter with a VMDK.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Role Author delivers a versioned ansible role artifact.  
    The role can be executed as-is with playbooks built in the 
    same way as when a playbook is executed, but in this case 
    the playbook and supporting files merely provide working 
    demonstration of the role, and role testing components.
    The artifact would include only the role and would be versioned. 
  </li>
  <li>Playbook Author delivers a versioned playbook artifact. 
    The artifact should stand alone in the sense that it should define 
    inventory and variables to deploy to a local stack brough up by 
    an included Vagrantfile.  This must also include some way of defining 
    which environment variables must be set for the playbook to execute.
  </li>
  <li>Operators update the per-environment 
    <code>inventory</code> and <code>group_vars</code> 
    repositories, using ansible-vault and environment-specific vault 
    passwords ( shared via eg Password Manager Pro and/or KSM) and 
    pushing an update to a versioned resource in S3.  A comparison job 
    should be in place to verify that each required environment variable 
    is set in each environment.  
  </li>
  <li>Images and CloudFormation templates (Vagrantfiles? other templates?)
    are cut for each environment.  These images would include 
    all necessary components for the images to function as desired. 
    Outlying cases ( eg long term block storage ) will be managed 
    by scripts on the host.  (In AWS, permissions will be granted via 
    an Instance Profile to manage these resources ).
  </li>
  <li>Cloud Formation stacks can be deployed at any time to any 
    environment, by simply creating the stack from the premade 
    template.  The stacks should define ASGs so they can heal 
    autonomously.  Etc.  
  </li>
